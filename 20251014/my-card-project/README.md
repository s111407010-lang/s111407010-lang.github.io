# My Card Project

This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a business card layout. It consists of two main sections: an image section and a text section, designed to present information in a visually appealing manner.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage, including two div blocks for the card layout. The left block displays the image `p1.png` with a circular mask, and the right block contains the text information.
- `style.css`: Includes the styles for the webpage, defining the layout, circular masking for the image, and aesthetic enhancements for the text and overall design of the card.

## Instructions to View the Card

1. Ensure you have the image `p1.png` in the same directory as `index.html`.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the card layout.
3. You can modify the text in `index.html` and the styles in `style.css` to customize the card as needed.

## Design Choices

- The circular mask for the image provides a modern and clean look, making the card visually appealing.
- The layout is responsive and centered, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
- The color scheme and typography are chosen to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.
